# iMessage Notifier

This is a small project that sends a notification to a computer when a text message is received. 
I don't keep my phone with me while I do schoolwork (to eliminate distractions), so this project allows
me to still receive important texts from family while I study.

## How to set up
1. Set up on phone
2. Set up for computer
   
### Phone-side: Shortcuts
1. Open the Shortcuts app and go to the automation page to make a new one.
2. Choose the Message automation and configure it to your liking.
3. For my use case, I select the "Run Immediately." You can also do key words if that fits your application.
4. Make the automation run script over ssh.
